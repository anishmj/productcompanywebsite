            Security software is any type of software that
             secures and protects a computer,
              network or any computing-enabled device.
               It manages access control, provides data protection,
                secures the system against viruses and network/Internet based intrusions
                , and defends against other system-level security risks.
            <br />
            Antivirus software was originally developed to detect 
            and remove computer viruses, hence the name. However
            , with the proliferation of other malware, antivirus software started to 
            protect from other computer threats. In particular, modern antivirus 
            software can protect users from malicious browser helper objects (BHOs), 
            browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits,
             trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraud tools, adware, 
             and spyware. Some products also include protection from other computer threats, 
             such as infected and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), 
             online banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT), and botnet DDoS attacks.
